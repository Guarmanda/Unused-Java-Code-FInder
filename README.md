# Unused-Code-FInder
Find unused Java classes and methods in a whole folder with sub directories

This isn't perfect: you can have some false positive, but it shouldn't forget any unused classes or method (It does, but in rare cases)

NONE of the plugins I tried worked, so I did my own program, usable of any project of any size with an infinite number of sub-directories.
It also detect classes or methods in spring xml files, so the program won't list usefull classes. BUT, it can list usefull methods.
