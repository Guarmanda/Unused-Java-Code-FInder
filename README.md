# Unused-Code-FInder
Find unused Java classes and methods in a whole folder with sub directories

This isn't perfect: you can have some false positive, but it shouldn't forget any unused classes or method (It does, but in rare cases)

NONE of the plugins I tried worked, so I did my own program, usable of any project of any size with an infinite number of sub-directories.
It also detect classes or methods in spring xml files, so the program won't list usefull classes. BUT, it can list usefull getters used in html files, because they are referenced only by their variable name.
